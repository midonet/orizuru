if you want to contribute to this project send a pull request (or do a ninja commit if you have permissions).

there is only one rule: before committing anything to master please make sure you had it running in YOUR testbed before pushing it.

this means: you write a new feature or fix a bug, you run make distclean, then you run make, and if it comes through (and your cloud has built successfully with midonet) you can PR or git push it.

thanks!
