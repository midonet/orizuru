BGP
===

Implementing a BGP mock testbed in containers is hard.

We therefore recommend you do the following (manual steps):

For each network card in the gateways, add them to the namespace of the gateway midonet agent:

```
ip link set p3p1 netns docker_22065_midonet_gateway_gw001
```
(Your number for the namespace may vary)

Do this for all gateways you have with two NICs.

If you dont have a second nic in the gateway: bad luck, no BGP testbed.

Now we need to set up the bgpd on the gateway

```
root@trgbe:/etc/quagga# cat daemons
zebra=yes
bgpd=yes
ospfd=no
ospf6d=no
ripd=no
ripngd=no
isisd=no
babeld=no
root@trgbe:/etc/quagga# cat zebra.conf
hostname trgbe
password zebra
enable password zebra

root@trgbe:/etc/quagga# cat bgpd.conf
#
# bgpd.conf
#

hostname trgbe
password zebra
enable password zebra

log file /var/log/quagga/bgpd.log
log stdout

 neighbor 192.168.6.103 remote-as 65103
 neighbor 192.168.6.103 next-hop-self
 neighbor 192.168.6.103 update-source 192.168.6.1

 neighbor 192.168.6.104 remote-as 65104
 neighbor 192.168.6.104 next-hop-self
 neighbor 192.168.6.104 update-source 192.168.6.1

 neighbor 192.168.6.106 remote-as 65106
 neighbor 192.168.6.106 next-hop-self
 neighbor 192.168.6.106 update-source 192.168.6.1

 # only enable this on demand
 # neighbor ${MIDONET_BGP_IP} timers 1 3
 # neighbor ${MIDONET_BGP_IP} timers connect 1
```

The next thing you will do is set up ports and bgp sessions on the gateways.

Note that you must do this AFTER the installer has been finishing creating networks.
```
midonet> cleart
midonet> router list name 'MidoNet Provider Router'
midonet> router router0 add port address 192.168.6.103 net 192.168.6.0/24
midonet> port list device router0 address 192.168.6.103
midonet> host list name midonet_gateway_gw001
midonet> host host0 add binding port router router0 port port0 interface p3p1
midonet> quit
```
Do this port binding for every midonet gateway that has a second network card.

Now we create the actual BGP session to each bgp router you have:
```
midonet> cleart
midonet> router list name 'MidoNet Provider Router'
midonet> router router0 port list address 192.168.6.103
midonet> router router0 port port0 add bgp local-AS 65103 peer-AS 65000 peer 192.168.6.1
midonet> router router0 port port0 bgp bgp0 add route net 200.200.200.0/24
midonet> quit
```
Again, do this for every port you have, one session per port.

Do not forget that the interface has to be up for the session to be started by midonet agent.

If the interface is not up please login to the host and up it.

As usual this config is appropriate for conf/alex.yaml. Your settings may differ.

Finally, do not forget to remove the default route going through the fake uplink ports (which is the default option of this installer).

If you do not like cli there is also the option of buying MEM and using the GUI :)
