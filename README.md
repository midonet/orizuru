Test drive Midonet.org or MEM (with Midonet Manager) together with Openstack on Ubuntu.

The installation of the services will take place on top of Docker Ubuntu images.

You only have to provide a list of (virtual or physical) servers which you define in a simple yaml file.

The installer will then create the containers on these servers and install Openstack with Midonet as part of a demo installation.
