roadmap (or what we learned when building this installer)
=========================================================

This installer is acollective effort learning from the mistakes when building our Midonet installers (like the infamous midokura/deployment-tools) and looking at how github/agabert/openstack-standalone-installer created a havana cloud cluster.

Keeping it simple was a smart decision back then.

Add some fabric and cuisine magic (thanks Daniel :)) plus the official Midokura puppet modules for automating all the things: you end up with this project.

Here are the goals for the next couple of months:

short term (1 day to 1 month):

- replace fakeuplink with code to talk to a physical or dockerized quagga daemon (if dockerized it will SNAT then)

There should be a switch in the config how the uplink is implemented (fakeuplink or bgp)

In the case of bgp the user should be able to have another switch that says if the bgp gateway should be autogenerated (as a container) or he provides bgp gateways

For bgp we will need to have a second interface on the midonet_gateway container and on the quagga_gateway container

Also we need AS numbers in the configs

- add vtep_gateway_container to the mix (follow instructions in wiki to bootstrap the ovsdb-server)

Then stage7 can ping the dummy IP on the fake L2 port from inside the cirros vm

- write a test in stage7 for load balancing (setting up the LB with native neutron calls)

We should then install httpd in at least three instances (with /var/www/html/index.html giving back an id) and do wget a lot to have a statistical significant sample for deciding if the LB works or not

medium term (1 month to 6 months):

- write the midonet puppet module for cassandra with the cluster_name fix in the startup

- add Docker container logic by Jaume so we dont have to install a lot of Midonet services ourself

long term (6 months to 12 months):

- wait for OpenStack to provide Docker images for all the OpenStack services, then replace our logic with those

- ipv6 testbed

- RHEL and CentOS support (might not happen because RHEL OSP Installer might get done before that)

- partition the installer into three phases (might not happen and be done in the next project):

Phase1: parallel: prepare host operating systems (dist upgrade, install packages)

Phase2: parallel: docker build (but do not configure anything specific)

Phase3: parallel: install openstack and midonet software (or build the appropriate containers cold)

Phase4: parallel: log into all openstack and midonet containers, configure them cold (alternatively docker run and configure with RUN commands doing puppet)

Phase5: start all the things sequential and in order (dependencies are important, otherwise certain services will fall down again)
